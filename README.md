# Bank_Churn_Prediction
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a bank customer will leave the bank (churn) based on several features such as tenure, balance, number of products, and more. It uses a machine learning model trained to classify customers as either staying or leaving based on historical data.
